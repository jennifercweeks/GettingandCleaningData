# GettingandCleaningData
##Programming assignment for Coursera's "Getting and Cleaning Data"

###Description
This dataset contains smartphone accelerometer & gyroscope readings 30 subjects while they performed six different activity types. <br>
<br>
Data source: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip <br>
<br>
The data tidying script "run_analysis.R" assumes you have downloaded and unzipped the data file above in your working directory. <br>
<br>
The script "run_analysis.R" will produce two tidy datasets: one containing means and standard deviations of all measured values ("meansandsds.txt"), and one containing averaged means of each value collapsing across subject and activity type ("tidymeans.txt") <br>
All steps in the algorithm are explained in the commented code. <br>
Please see the codebook.md in this repository for a description of variables. <br>
<br>
For more information on how data was collected, please refer to README.txt file contained in original dataset.
